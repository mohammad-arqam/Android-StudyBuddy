Study Buddy

The Study Buddy quiz tool will provide students with practice for tests and examinations in multiple
subject areas with flashcard like questions. Users will be able to create and modify flashcards 
and design their own practice questions. It will provide users a way to run quizzes based on these
flashcards, which will show them feedback and a score at the end.

The Study Buddy quiz tool will feature the ability to create new flash cards that will contain a
subject, difficulty rating, question, hints, and answer. The difficulty of each question will be 
categorized into 3 types: easy, medium, and hard. The user will be able to choose any of these 3 
difficulties for their quizzes. There will be an optional hint attached to each card for the user 
to use when they are stuck on a question. The flashcards will also record a history of how the 
question was answered to allow users to see which questions they are struggling with.

The Study Buddy will maintain all flashcards the user created allowing them to be used again at 
a later date. They can view these cards and edit their contents after they have been created to
change answers or details. Users will also be able to delete flashcards they no longer need. Users
will also have the ability to import and export multiple flash cards from a file. 

The system will allow users to run a quiz. The quiz length, subject, and difficulty will be chosen
by the user before the quiz begins. The user can specify one subject or all subjects to be used
in the quiz. Once completed, the quiz will return a result to the user, specifying their 
performance. It will display how many questions they answered correctly, how many hints used,
and give them a score. 

The Study Buddy will be used by students to practice for tests or anyone who wants to improve their 
knowledge in any area of academics or general life. It will allow any user to get solid, objective
feedback on their current abilities in a field and will be a good resource for comparing progress 
in knowledge retained in the future. 

The project will be considered a success if it is easy to use and understand for users, and if they
prefer this system over their previous study methods or physical flash cards. We will survey users 
Using this system to determine if they prefer using our system over physical flash cards. The survey
will ask their satisfaction out of 10 to measure how they feel about our system. We will
also compare test scores of our users before and after they use our tool. Our system should leave 
users feeling more confident with their understanding in a subject area and wanting to use the 
Study Buddy quiz tool again.
